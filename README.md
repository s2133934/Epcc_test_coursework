## Epcc Code testing and profiling coursework
### The EPCC template for coursework used here to create my coursework submission

In a nutshell, we were given a program in C, and asked to test and profile the code. I am not familiar with C so this task will prove a challenge! 

Unit testing, and regression testing were employed here to run, time and test the code. I chose to vary the size of the grid used by the code, and also the compiler optimisation flags used by gcc, and the relative speedup was measured and reported here.
